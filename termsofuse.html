        <p>
            “Intellectual Property Rights” means all present and future rights conferred
             by statute, common law or equity in or in relation to any copyright and 
             related rights, trademarks, illustrations, art, designs, patents, inventions, goodwill and the 
             right to sue for passing off, rights to inventions, rights to use, and all 
             other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or 
             unregistered and including all applications and rights to apply for and be 
             granted, rights to claim priority from, such rights and all similar or 
             equivalent rights or forms of protection and any other results of 
             intellectual activity which subsist or will subsist now or in the future in 
             any part of the world. This Agreement does not transfer to you any 
             intellectual property owned by the Operator or third parties, and all rights,
              titles, and interests in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) 
              solely with the Operator. All trademarks, service marks, graphics, images, drawings and logos used in
               connection with the Website and Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks 
               of the Operator or its licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and 
               logos used in connection with the Website and Services may be the trademarks of 
               other third parties. Your use of the Website and Services grants you no right or 
               license to misuse any of the Operator or third party trademarks or claim them as your own.

            You agree to indemnify and hold the Operator and its affiliates, directors, 
            officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors harmless from and against 
            any liabilities, losses, damages or costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees,

            applicable and binding only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable
             laws and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not 
             render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or portion 
             of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or 
             unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties
              that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement 
              with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or
               portions thereof shall remain in full force and effect.

             shall be governed by the substantive and procedural laws of Denmark without regard to its rules on
              conflicts or choice of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of Denmark. 
              The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the courts
               located in Denmark, and you hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
        </p>
